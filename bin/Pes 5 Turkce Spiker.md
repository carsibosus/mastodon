# Pes 5 Turkce Spiker: How to Enjoy the Classic Soccer Game with Turkish Commentary
 
Pes 5, also known as Pro Evolution Soccer 5, is a soccer game that was released in 2005 by Konami. It is one of the most popular and acclaimed games in the series, featuring realistic gameplay, licensed teams and players, and various modes. However, one of the drawbacks of Pes 5 is that it does not have an official Turkish commentary option, which can be disappointing for Turkish fans who want to enjoy the game with their native language.

The patch is not fully completed yet, so some parts of the commentary may still be in English, but it is still a great improvement over the default option.
